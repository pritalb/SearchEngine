    <h1>Anime</h1>
    <p>
        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 
        Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers to Japanese animation, and refers specifically to animation produced in 
        Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes 
        all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese 
        animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.
