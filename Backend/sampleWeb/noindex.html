    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <p>
        The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant 
        of the wolf, and is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct 
        wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be 
        domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due 
        to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals 
        and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
