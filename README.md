# SearchEngine
A basic Search Engine made using Django and ReactJs.

Crawling the web is a Tremendous and Resource intensive task. Therefore, to keep the
    project feasible, I decided to have the Web Crawler work on a handful of static
    websites I made as a sort of sample mini web.
    The sites of this sample web were hosted using IBM Cloud Object Storage with the
    Seed page having the url (https://sites.s3.jp-tok.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/seed.html).
    
    Since resources created using the free, IBM Cloud lite account are deleted after about a month of
    inactivity, the sample web may not be there in future.
